Inventory System Project – One Piece Anime Theme

Hellooo! 👋  

This is an Inventory System Project that I built from scratch to completion, inspired by the One Piece anime. The inventory includes various props and weapons from the series, each with unique values and quantities.  

Key Features:  
🛒Dynamic Inventory System → At the start, the player has no items, but as they gather resources, their inventory fills with random items from a predefined list. Players can    buy and sell items** based on availability.  

🎭 Scriptable Objects for Item Management → Each item is defined as a Scriptable Object, making it easier to manage attributes and expand the inventory.  

🛠 MVC Pattern for Shop & Player Inventory → Ensures scalability and maintainability, keeping the system modular and easy to update.  

🔄 Dependency Injection for Script Communication → Allows clean and flexible interactions between different scripts.  

🔁 Observer Pattern for Buying & Selling Items → Efficiently handles real-time inventory updates when players make transactions.  

Using these design patterns significantly improved the structure, maintainability, and flexibility of the project. 🚀  

Let me know your thoughts! 😊
